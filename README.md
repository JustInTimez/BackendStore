# BED BackendStore
A vanilla PHP 'online' store website. Created using OOP principles and SESSIONS. This site mimicks the functionality of a online store without the legitimate transaction taking place. User is able to view and 'purchase' games. 

## Description
This site enables a user to view games, view game details as well as a functioning SESSION cart/login system. The user can also make a 'purchase' (no transaction).

As a user on this site, you are able to:

- [x] Browse the website without having to register and/or login first.
- [x] If the user wants to add to cart, the user will need to either register on the system or log in if they are already registered.
- [x] Filter products by their platform.
- [x] Latest additions as well as Featured games are displayed on the homepage.
- [x] View pages with additional content such as About Us, a LookBook (gallery of product images) and a Contact page.
- [x] Create orders.
- [x] Add to Cart.
- [x] Cart order total is calculated and displayed.
- [x] Payment of cart.

What I want to add in the future:
- [ ] Tighter validation on register and login.
- [ ] Cart Enhancements:
    - [ ] Reduce stock on each order confirmation.
    - [ ] Display total amount of products in cart.
- [ ] Modify/come up with a different idea for the LookBook.


## Using the site/app

- Please find the export of the database in the folder path **/data/sql_export/**
- Import the database so that you may use it with your AMP software and PHP MyAdmin with this project
- Additionally, copy the folder to your htdocs folder and host it via your AMP software.

If you want to test the login feature, please use these credentials: _justin@woohoo.com_ | _1234_<br>
Otherwise, register a new account - you will be directed to the homepage.<br>
You now have access to add items to your cart - and then to make a 'purchase' when happy!<br>
